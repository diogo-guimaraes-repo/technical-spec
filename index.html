          JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
          is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
          example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
          its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
          and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
          structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
          variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
          example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
            to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
            HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
            and page navigation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
            relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
            the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
          </li>

          JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
          in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
          Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
          Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
          constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
          JavaScript.
        </p>

        <p>
          In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
          declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
          number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
          JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
          class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
          inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
          JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
          requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
          loosely typed methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
          have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
          be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
          you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
          function return types are not explicitly typed.

        You can declare a variable in three ways:
        <p>
          With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare both local and global variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
          always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
          warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
          can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
          below.
        </p>

      <article>
        <p>
          When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
          global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
          current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
          called a local variable, because it is available only within that
          function.
        </p>

        <p>
          JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
          rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
          global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
          code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
          context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
          is an if statement.
        </p>
        <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
        <p>
          This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
          ECMAScript 2015.
        </p>

        <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not
          defined</code>

        A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
        statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

        <ul>
          <li>The name of the function.</li>
          <li>
            A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
            separated by commas.
          </li>
          <li>
            The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly
            brackets, { }.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:
        </p>

        <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
        <p>
          The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
          consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
          function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement
          specifies the value returned by the function.
        </p>
        <code>return number * number;</code>
        <p>
          Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
          value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes
          the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in
          the calling function.
